Twitch, Youtube
=======

Since the original seems down, here's an alternative. It only works for Twitch and YouTube, I didn't bother to set it for WASD.

This is a bot for Telegram.

Write to [@AnotherTwitchMonitorBot](https://t.me/AnotherTwitchMonitorBot) and use it!

Run

Use node-twiMon_example as the service for init.d or enter in console:

```bash
node dist/main.js
```

Or use docker compose for selfhost (but create and setup `.env` file first!):

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
